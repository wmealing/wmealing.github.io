<h1 class="title">Python range operator in lisp.</h1>
<p>
I've sometimes wanted a quick 'range' equivalent in common lisp.  There are likely other or easier ways to do it
but this way is mine.
</p>

<p>
Simple example to make a list for use:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org54e89be">
(loop for i from 1 to 5 collect i)
</pre>

<p>
Easy, runs from 1 to 5, makes a list, its not lazy.. I don't think, but maybe there is a better generator.
</p>

<p>
Say if only evens were desired:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-lisp">(loop for i from 1 to 10 do (when (evenp i)) collect i)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
note: that none of this is lazy, its not ideal.
</p>

<p>
There used to be another github library titled "Generators The Way I Want Them Generated" which looks really cool
but the account ahs been deleted.  I have a clone of a the source on quicklisp/ultralisp
<a href="https://github.com/wmealing/gtwiwtg">https://github.com/wmealing/gtwiwtg</a> although it seems that mr cbeo (the original owner) account has
terminated.  
</p>

<p>
The other alternative is 'snakes' which is available from <a href="https://github.com/BnMcGn/snakes">https://github.com/BnMcGn/snakes</a>.
</p>

<p>
When I get around to needing the lazyness of them, i'll put some demos here.
