# Why sign a kernel module ?

  The process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software
  author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted since it
  was signed. The process employs the use of a cryptographic hash to validate
  authenticity and integrity

# How is it signed ?

  Each kernel module is signed with a industry standard PKCS#7 standard 
  (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652),  and the signature generated by a
  compile time specified hashing algorithm ( CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_HASH ) when the
  module is built.

  This signature is consulted by the kernel code (not userspace) when the
  module is loaded.   There a number of cryptographic hash algorithms added
  over time.  While many can be chosen from, a module can be signed by only
  one.
 
  The supported hash algorithms for a release can be found in the kernels build
   
  ~~~
  # grep CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_  ~/fast/rhel-8/redhat/configs/*config | sort| uniq

  CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL=y
  # CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE is not set
  CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_HASH="sha256"
  CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY="certs/signing_key.pem"
  # CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA1 is not set
  # CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA224 is not set
  CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA256=y
  # CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA384 is not set
  # CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA512 is not set
  ~~~

  From this you can see that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 defaults to sha256 and
  only supports sha256 signed kernel modules.  These options are used at build
  time and runtime of the kernel that is being built.

# Kernel modules information.
  
## Module location

   Kernel modules provided by the operating system vendors are located in the
   root or subdirectory of the default search path (of /lib/modules/(`uname -a`)
   ).  There is provision for third party modules to exist within this directory
   that are able to override operating system vendor defaults by using the
   'updates' or 'extras' sub-directories.
   
   Modules can be loaded from outside this tree, the complex iteractions of
   searching and priority is documented in the depmod and depmod.d man pages.

## Loading kernel modules.

   Modules can be loaded manually using the insmod/modprobe but also the kernel
   can load modules on demand to meet attached hardware requirements or
   protocols. The three (that i know of) protocols are:

   - Network Protocol use.
   - Hotplugged hardware.
   - Filesystem 

   Each of these events can fire off a userspace helper which can load a
   module. This userspace helper consults the modules.dep file created by
   depmod to locate the relevant module to meet the kernels request.
   
## The signature
 
### Signature metadata.

  The /sbin/modinfo program can inspect details about the kernel module.  The

  There is an additional text string "~Module signature appended~" also at the
  end of the file, which does not seem to serve a purpose other than a simple
  identifier to determine if the module signature is included.

  Some earlier implementations of kernel module signing had included it as part of the 
  'ELF' section tables but this appears to have been deprecated in favour of
  the simpler appending to the file.

# Version support table

 The first implementation of signing kernel modules appeared in Red Hat
 Enterprise Linux 5.  This was available and enabled in Enterprise Linux before
 it was available in Fedora and other distributions.

 Kernel module signature verification is not enabled by default but can be
 enabled by booting the kernel with an addition parameter as shown below:


| Version                    | Kernel boot parameter |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 | enforcemodulesig=1    |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 | enforcedmodulesign=1  |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 | module.sig_enforce=1  |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 | module.sig_enforce=1  |


For releases with full 'secureboot' support, (7 and later), module signature
verification is required unless explicitly stated by inverting the above kernel
boot parameter.

When IMA is enabled, kernel module signing support is enforced.

# Source

* How the kernel loads the module.

   The kernel has two entry paths of loading a module.  I'm still slightly
   confused about why there are two, but what do I know.
   
   These functions are: init_module() and  finit_module()

   TODO: finit_module skipsis some kind of validation around signatures.
   TODO: does finit_module skip the whole sign check process, wtf ?

   These call mod_check_sig() and mod_read_sig().

   The mod_read_sig() function parses out the signature from the module. (the
   signature is a fixed size)

   The module_sig_check() function passes most of the logic off to
   mod_verify_sig() which is where most of the action is,

   It verifies it against the 'built-in' trusted key and secondary trusted keys.

   ~~~
   mod_verify_sig() {
   
           /*
         * Check signature using built-in trusted keys and, if configured,
         * secondary trusted keys.
         */
        err =  verify_pkcs7_signature(mod, modlen, mod + modlen, sig_len,
                                      VERIFY_USE_SECONDARY_KEYRING,
                                      VERIFYING_MODULE_SIGNATURE,
                                      NULL, NULL);
        if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_INTEGRITY_PLATFORM_KEYRING) && err) {
                /*
                 * Check signature using platform trusted keys. This does
                 * not consider the built-in keys, so must be done separately
                 * from above, if possible and necessary.
                 */
                err =  verify_pkcs7_signature(mod, modlen, mod + modlen,
                                              sig_len,
                                              VERIFY_USE_PLATFORM_KEYRING,
                                              VERIFYING_MODULE_SIGNATURE,
                                              NULL, NULL);
        }
        return err;


   }
   ~~~

   The mentioned CONFIG_INTEGRITY_PLATFORM_KEYRING code allows for kexec to
   work correctly.  I really don't know what its doing here in the module
   loading code.

   ~~~
   config INTEGRITY_PLATFORM_KEYRING
        bool "Provide keyring for platform/firmware trusted keys"
        depends on INTEGRITY_ASYMMETRIC_KEYS
        depends on SYSTEM_BLACKLIST_KEYRING
        depends on EFI
        help
         Provide a separate, distinct keyring for platform trusted keys, which
         the kernel automatically populates during initialization from values
         provided by the platform for verifying the kexec'ed kerned image
         and, possibly, the initramfs signature.
   ~~~

   From initial research this appears to be the ".builtin_trusted_keys" keyring.

   ~~~
   # keyctl list %:.builtin_trusted_keys 
   ~~~

   These keys will only show when booted in secureboot mode with secureboot in
   a reputable state.

   Sidenote: 
   
   There is support upstream for CONFIG_SECONDARY_TRUSTED_KEYRING but this is
   not enabled in any shipping version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

   Keys in the secondary trusted keyring need to be somehow trusted by the
   first key, so I'm not sure how thats supposed to happen and why you wouldnt
   just put them in the first keyring.   It might be that they need to be added
   via mokutil ?
   
# Failure modes.

   The kernel module signature check 'fails closed' leaving it up to the admin
   controlled parameter to decide on the behavior.
   
   This is on the decided in module_sig_check: 

  ```C
  static int module_sig_check(struct load_info *info, int flags) {

    err = mod_verify_sig(mod, info);

    switch(err) {

      case 0: /* module okay to load */
         return 0;

      case -ENODATA: /* Loading of unsigned module */
         goto decide;

      case -ENOPKG:  /* Unknown crypto on module */
         goto decide;

      case -ENOKEY:  /* unavailable key (not in current chain */
         goto decide;

      decide:
        if (is_module_sig_enforced()) {
                  pr_notice("%s: %s is rejected\n", info->name, reason);
                  return -EKEYREJECTED;
        }

        return security_locked_down(LOCKDOWN_MODULE_SIGNATURE);

        /* All other errors are fatal, including nomem, unparseable */

      default:
        return err;

    }
  }        
  ```

# Adding a second signature to the keychain for third party modules:

  If the system is not UEFI-based or if UEFI Secure Boot is not
  enabled, then only the keys that are embedded in the kernel are loaded onto the
  system key ring and you have no ability to augment that set of keys without
  rebuilding the kernel and signing all kernel modules with your own key.

  However, if the system uses secure boot and its an option..

  Secureboot has a provision for adding 'additional' keys to the 'platform'
  keyring, it uses a Machine Owner Key (MOK) to add additional keys to the UEFI
  secure boot database, adding them to 'system' keyring for use.

  The Red Hat Enterprise Linux boot process uses the shim.efi, MokManager.efi,
  grubx64.efi and each of these supports the "MOK" style keyring addition.

  Once a key has been added to generated and added to the via mokutil, on the
  next reboot the user will required to input a passphrase at the physical
  console (the same that was generated when the key was created).

  This allows local users to be able to add keys to the system keychain that
  are able to be used to validate signatures of kernel modules.

# Creating a public and private key

  Create a file configuration_file.config  with the following contents,
  modifying O and CN options.

~~~
[ req ]
default_bits = 4096
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
prompt = no
string_mask = utf8only
x509_extensions = myexts

[ req_distinguished_name ]
O = Organization
CN = Organization signing key
emailAddress = E-mail address

[ myexts ]
basicConstraints=critical,CA:FALSE
keyUsage=digitalSignature
subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid
EOF
~~~

From this file use openssl to generate a public and private key pairs which can
be used to sign the kernel module and also enrolled in the systems "MOK" keychain.

~~~
# openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -utf8 -sha256 -days 36500 -batch -config configuration_file.config -outform DER  -out public_key.der \ > -keyout  private_key.priv
~~~

The openssl command should create two files, public_key.der and
private_key.priv.

* Enrolling the key into the MOK keychain.

 ~~~
# mokutil --import public_key.der
~~~


You will be asked to enter and confirm a password for this MOK enrollment
request.

Reboot the machine.

The shim.efi will notice that there is a pending MOK enrollment and start
MokManager.efi to complete the enrollment.  The password used during the
certificate generation process will need to be entered at the console during
the early-boot stage to confirm that this key is to be enrolled.

This public key will now be in the MOK list and be added to the system key ring
on all future boots (until cleared) while secureboot is enabled.

For example:
  
~~~ 
  # keyctl list %:.system_keyring

# Signing a kernel module

  Before the module can be loaded it must be signed, there is a sign-file
  script included in the kernel source ./scripts/ directory which provides 
  compatible a compatible signing technique that is able to be used for 'out of
  tree' built kernel modules.  An example of singing my_module
 
~~~
  perl /usr/src/kernels/$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 private_key.priv public_key.der my_module.ko
~~~
    

  FIXME: confirm the signature with modinfo.

  FIXME: mention that signing doesn't have be on the machine that is running
  the kernel module ideally.
