* [[./cellium-focus.html][Cellium 002]]- Oct 2025

I have wanted some helpers built into my TUI libraries that help differentiate when a widget has focus.  Ive made
a rudimentary attempt at adding focus to the 'cellium' behavior, you can read about how to use it to your advantage h
[[http://wmealing.github.io/cellium-focus.html][here.]]

* [[./cellium-first.html][Cellium 001]] - Oct 2025.

In an attempt to make my erlang code a little less complex, i've been convinced that I must drop the web and all the
complexity that entails. I've written a TUI library called [[https://github.com/wmealing/cellium][cellium]] which uses the popular TEA architecture to lull developers
into a sense of familiarity. 


* [[https://wmealing.github.io/github-not-connecting.html][Rebar3 / git not connecting to github]] - Oct 2025

Rebar3 was failing to fetch dependencies from github when I was setting up a new LFE project. The git:// protocol was timing out, but ssh and https worked fine. Rather than spending hours debugging network issues I can't control, I found a simple fix using git's url rewriting feature. One config command later and rebar3 can fetch dependencies without complaint. I
have documented a fix in git itself that works around the problme.  This applies to regular Erlang projects too!.

* [[https://wmealing.github.io/eunit-surefire-report.html][Consuming eunit surefire xml reports]] - Oct 2025

Eunit spits out test results to the console, but sometimes you want something a bit more presentable. There is a plugin that generates surefire style XML output, and you can use maven's surefire-reports tool to turn that into HTML. I'll show you how to wire up rebar.config and create a basic pom.xml to get this working. If you need better test reports for your Erlang projects, this might help.

* [[https://wmealing.github.io/erlang-emacs-2025.html][Setting up Emacs and Erlang in 2025.]] - Sep 2025

Using Erlang in Emacs, I'll show  you to wire up OTP, tree-sitter, Flycheck, rebar3, and WhatsApp’s new LSP into
a usable setup in 2025.   Its simpler than you think.  If you can think of any improvements please let me know.

* [[./robust-recovery.html][Robust Recovery in Erlang]]  - Aug 2025

Managing failureis a common challenge, especially when some of those tasks are prone to failure.

Erlang, with its actor process model, offers an elegant solution.

This post dives into a practical example of how to orchestrate a number of jobs, monitor each one for success or
failure, and then compile a report on theff outcomes. We'll explore how Erlang's unique approach to
fault tolerance allows a central process to supervise many workers, and handling their failure however you see fit. 


* [[https://wmealing.github.io/using-style-dictionaries.html][Using Style Dictionaries from clojure]]

Unify your design system and codebase the functional way. In this post, I’ll show you how to harness the power of Style Dictionary
from Clojure—turning token files for use in your clojure code with minimal fuss. Learn how to bring structured, scalable theming into
your Clojure workflow.


* [[http://wmealing.github.io/sending-email-in-common-lisp.html][Sending email in common-lisp (Sep 2024)]]

Want to integrate email functionality into your common-lisp applications, the cl-smtp library can help. In this blog entry, we’ll walk you through the process of using cl-smtp
to send emails via Google’s mail servers. Whether you're setting up notifications, alerts, or just automating your email processes, this guide will help you configure cl-smtp to
work seamlessly with Gmail’s SMTP server.

:LOGBOOK:
- Note taken on [2024-09-08 Sun 21:42]
:END:

Writing clear and effective error messages is a crucial skill for any programmer, no matter what the language.  Well-crafted error messages will
improve the usability of software by guiding users to understand and resolve issues quickly. A good error message not only informs the user about
what went wrong but also suggests potential solutions or next steps. In this introductory paragraph, we will explore key principles and techniques
that can help developers create error messages that are informative, actionable, and user-friendly and more importantly take advantage of any
assistance and resources that you may have at your disposal.  I expanded on this a bit more [[https://wmealing.github.io/custom-software-errors.html][here]].

* [[http://wmealing.github.io/mac-os-midi-router-broken.html][Apple Mac OS Midi routing is broken.]]

I have some new music making hardware, and wanted to try to get them to talk together.  Use a Mac they
say 'everything just works',   No clearly it doesnt.  I did however find a work around.  If anyone
is trying to use a USB host to route a midi controller (USB organ) to a synth (USB) start [[http://wmealing.github.io/mac-os-midi-router-broken.html][Reading]]

* [[http://wmealing.github.io/minimise.html][Minimise]]

In the interest of not polluting the internet with my ill-informed opinion and staying
away from the madness that is modern culture, I've deleted a bunch of social media and
messenger accounts.  Less of me on the internet can only be a net win for society.


* [[./reverse-engineering-teenage-engineering.html][Downloading the EP133 firmware from Teenage Engineering]]

Teenage Engineering released the EP-133, a mid range sampler/synth, I looked into the updater
to find out as much as I can before I buy one.  The firmware provided from teenage engineering
is encrypted, but i've [[./reverse-engineering-teenage-engineering.html][documented what i have found so far.]]

* [[https://wmealing.github.io/atomic-operations-in-common-lisp.html][Atom(ic) Operations in Common Lisp]] [2023]

So, the headline is a bit of a lie.  This entry talks about using clojure like "atoms" to simplify
management of shared, synchronous, independent state.  Common lisp being the all-singing all-dancing
monkey of the lisp world, i had to see if atoms can be used this way.  It turns out it is easier
than I thought. [[https://wmealing.github.io/atomic-operations-in-common-lisp.html][Check it.]]


* [[https://wmealing.github.io/lfe-github-actions.html][Setting up GitHub Actions for LFE CI/CD]] [2023]

I'm involved in 'competing' with [[https://spawnfest.org/][spawnfest]] this weekend, I figured its time to setup [[file:lfe-github-actions.html][LFE for CI/CD with GitHub Actions]].
Its a pretty simple setup that runs the test, i'll expand on this in the future to include creating containers and
pushing to production.

* [[https://wmealing.github.io/htmx-common-lisp.html][Common Lisp and HTMX]] [2023]

Common lisp and HTMX provide a sane platform to develop basic applications.  I [[https://wmealing.github.io/htmx-common-lisp.html][outline the reasons]] that I have chosen them.
This post also marks the new voice I plan to use while blogging. I no longer care to engage in debate with people without being paid.

* [[./emacs-org-babel-analysis.html ][Supercharge your workflow with emacs and org-babel]].

I do kernel flaw analysis for a living, someone asked me to do a short write up on how I use org-babel to
do my work. I've documented it [[./emacs-org-babel-analysis.html][in this rant]].

* [[./lfe-gen-server.html][Lisp Flavored Erlang Gen Server - 2024.]]

I decided to collapse two of my interests, lisp and erlang.  Lisp flavored erlang isnt going to win
any popularity contests, but it is something that I dont entirely hate  working on.  Ive written
a quick tutorial describing one of the [[https://wmealing.github.io/lfe-gen-server.html][core features of erlang]].

* [[./less-than-optimistic.html][Choosing the wrong roads.]]

I've spent the last week reflecting on some poor programming life choices that I've made.
disagree with the majority, perhaps you are wrong.  I'm not stupid enough to think that i'm smarter
than most people.  To be honest its probably not worth reading because you already think just like
this.  If I [[https://wmealing.github.io/less-than-optimistic.html][write about it]], perhaps it will clear my mind.

* COBOL - Simple "Curses" like screen to get keyboard input.

On of the simple but effectively powerful things that gnuCOBOL can do is a TUI.  Its not
fancy (when it implements UTF8 correctly, it will be fancy-af) but it gets the job
done much quicker than most webapps do.

Check out my [[./simple-cobol-query.html][Simple example]] which I've got working on Linux and MacOS X.

* Python Range function in lisp [Aug 2022]

I have wanted a quick way to something similar to the python range function (range n y) in common lisp.
Sometimes I just want to have some kind of immediate list creation.  [[http://wmealing.github.io/lisp-range][See my drivel on this topic.]]

* Simple WX example in erlang [July 2022]

I don't always write a gui for my apps, but when I do, I use wx because I'm not one for complaining about pixel perfect pedantry.

The one that works for me at the moment is [[http://wmealing.github.io/wx-erlang-example][WX Erlang]]

* MIRAI analysis - evasion - deleting the executing code [Nov 2020]

The MIRAI malware deletes itself from disk in an attempt to make it
harder to analyse. [[https://wmealing.github.io/mirai-delete-yourself][This post]] goes into detail on how it works, a rust
implementation and a few improvements that could have been done.

* MIRAI analysis - watchdog access in rust [Nov 2020]

The MIRAI malware uses an technique intended to prevent the systems
watchdog from rebooting the machine when its too busy.  [[https://wmealing.github.io/watchdog-in-rust][I share what I learned about this and ported it to rust.]]

* Userspace eBPF [Sep 2 2020]

A few distros have users allowed to insert eBPF programs.  This is disabled in
some distributions.  [[./ebpf-disabled-for-users.html][I've documented my findings]] after talking to different
decision holders who made some of these choices.

* Anatomy of kernel module signing  [Aug 20 2020]

I decided to take a look at the Linux kernel modules signing process.  It seems
that the recent drovorub malware has some interesting misinformation regarding 
module signing, so I had decided to take a look at the [[./signed-kernel-modules.html][regarding its implementations on Red hat Enterprise Linux]].

* Encrypting a disk to only boot in a specific system. [Aug 9 2020]

Recent research papers related to flaws in thunderbolt and secureboot have
piqued my interest in learning more about what can be done to prevent a system
comprimised in such a way from being abused.  I've written about
[[./tpm-pcr07.html][it here]]

* Toshiba Toughpad FZ-G1-3 [Jul 25 2020]

I have recently purchased one of these machines in an auction, and I am -very-
impressed with its build quality.   While this one is not its current purchase
release, I've got a page talking about the customizations and things I have
learned about it [[./toshiba-toughpad-fz-g1-3][While making it work for me]]



* Kernel SecuriTea

I work on a small youtube channel where I talk about kernel security issues
that interest me.  I work on quite a lot of these in my work so i'm limited to
what I can cover.
