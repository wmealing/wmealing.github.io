<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge619bc7">
<p>
Tired of the compile-restart-cycle anti-pattern in Erlang development? It sacrifices the core advantage of OTP:
continuous introspection. Using the remote shell workflow is the answer, transforming your text editor, specifically
Emacs, into a dynamic window directly into your running Erlang system.
</p>

<p>
Stop treating your Erlang application like a fragile, traditional compiled binary. By leveraging the oldschool power of remsh
(remote shell), you gain the ability to inspect, interact with, and even update code in-situ. This is the
essence of Erlang's "operational elegance"—it's not just "let it crash," it's "fix it in a live system."
Embrace this workflow for true live, continuous development and maintenance, allowing you to build the
highly available, fault-tolerant systems Erlang was designed for, without ever needing to stop.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org05321d7">
<p>
Sometimes a simple text percentage isn't enough, you need bars; you need a visual indicator to show the user that work is
actually being done. The progress bar provides a clean, terminal-friendly bar that you can update dynamically. We'll dive
into the Erlang source, look at how the percentage is clamped to a valid range. It's a small piece of code, but a necessary
addition to the widget toolkit that you can use, TODAY!

In an attempt to make my erlang code a little less complex, i've been convinced that I must drop the web and all the

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7a9fd50">
<p>
Rebar3 was failing to fetch dependencies from github when I was setting up a new LFE project. The git:// protocol was timing out, but ssh and https worked fine. Rather than spending hours debugging network issues I can't control, I found a simple fix using git's url rewriting feature. One config command later and rebar3 can fetch dependencies without complaint. I
have documented a fix in git itself that works around the problme.  This applies to regular Erlang projects too!.

<p>
Eunit spits out test results to the console, but sometimes you want something a bit more presentable. There is a plugin that generates surefire style XML output, and you can use maven's surefire-reports tool to turn that into HTML. I'll show you how to wire up rebar.config and create a basic pom.xml to get this working. If you need better test reports for your Erlang projects, this might help.

Managing failureis a common challenge, especially when some of those tasks are prone to failure.
</p>

<p>
Erlang, with its actor process model, offers an elegant solution.

This post dives into a practical example of how to orchestrate a number of jobs, monitor each one for success or
failure, and then compile a report on theff outcomes. We'll explore how Erlang's unique approach to
fault tolerance allows a central process to supervise many workers, and handling their failure however you see fit.

Writing clear and effective error messages is a crucial skill for any programmer, no matter what the language.  Well-crafted error messages will
improve the usability of software by guiding users to understand and resolve issues quickly. A good error message not only informs the user about
what went wrong but also suggests potential solutions or next steps. In this introductory paragraph, we will explore key principles and techniques
that can help developers create error messages that are informative, actionable, and user-friendly and more importantly take advantage of any
assistance and resources that you may have at your disposal.  I expanded on this a bit more <a href="https://wmealing.github.io/custom-software-errors.html">here</a>.
