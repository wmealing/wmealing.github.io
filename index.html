<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc437f3c">
<p>
Writing clear and effective error messages is a crucial skill for any programmer, no matter what the language.  Well-crafted error messages will
improve the usability of software by guiding users to understand and resolve issues quickly. A good error message not only informs the user about
what went wrong but also suggests potential solutions or next steps. In this introductory paragraph, we will explore key principles and techniques
that can help developers create error messages that are informative, actionable, and user-friendly and more importantly take advantage of any
assistance and resources that you may have at your disposal.  I expanded on this a bit more <a href="https://wmealing.github.io/custom-software-errors.html">here</a>.

So, the headline is a bit of a lie.  This entry talks about using clojure like "atoms" to simplify
management of shared, synchronous, independent state.  Common lisp being the all-singing all-dancing
monkey of the lisp world, i had to see if atoms can be used this way.  It turns out it is easier

I've spent the last week reflecting on some poor programming life choices that I've made.
disagree with the majority, perhaps you are wrong.  I'm not stupid enough to think that i'm smarter
than most people.  To be honest its probably not worth reading because you already think just like
this.  If I <a href="https://wmealing.github.io/less-than-optimistic.html">write about it</a>, perhaps it will clear my mind.
