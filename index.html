<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd8fdc51">
<p>
Managing failureis a common challenge, especially when some of those tasks are prone to failure.
</p>

<p>
Erlang, with its actor process model, offers an elegant solution.
</p>

<p>
This post dives into a practical example of how to orchestrate a number of jobs, monitor each one for success or
failure, and then compile a report on theff outcomes. We'll explore how Erlang's unique approach to
fault tolerance allows a central process to supervise many workers, and handling their failure however you see fit.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org68b8967">
<p>
Writing clear and effective error messages is a crucial skill for any programmer, no matter what the language.  Well-crafted error messages will
improve the usability of software by guiding users to understand and resolve issues quickly. A good error message not only informs the user about
what went wrong but also suggests potential solutions or next steps. In this introductory paragraph, we will explore key principles and techniques
that can help developers create error messages that are informative, actionable, and user-friendly and more importantly take advantage of any
assistance and resources that you may have at your disposal.  I expanded on this a bit more <a href="https://wmealing.github.io/custom-software-errors.html">here</a>.

So, the headline is a bit of a lie.  This entry talks about using clojure like "atoms" to simplify

disagree with the majority, perhaps you are wrong.  I'm not stupid enough to think that i'm smarter

this.  If I <a href="https://wmealing.github.io/less-than-optimistic.html">write about it</a>, perhaps it will clear my mind.
