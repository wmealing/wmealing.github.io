<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org97fb1b8">
<p>
Rebar3 was failing to fetch dependencies from github when I was setting up a new LFE project. The git:// protocol was timing out, but ssh and https worked fine. Rather than spending hours debugging network issues I can't control, I found a simple fix using git's url rewriting feature. One config command later and rebar3 can fetch dependencies without complaint. I
have documented a fix in git itself that works around the problme.  This applies to regular Erlang projects too!.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb6a7923">
<p>
Eunit spits out test results to the console, but sometimes you want something a bit more presentable. There is a plugin that generates surefire style XML output, and you can use maven's surefire-reports tool to turn that into HTML. I'll show you how to wire up rebar.config and create a basic pom.xml to get this working. If you need better test reports for your Erlang projects, this might help.

<p>
Managing failureis a common challenge, especially when some of those tasks are prone to failure.
</p>

<p>
Erlang, with its actor process model, offers an elegant solution.

<p>
This post dives into a practical example of how to orchestrate a number of jobs, monitor each one for success or
failure, and then compile a report on theff outcomes. We'll explore how Erlang's unique approach to
fault tolerance allows a central process to supervise many workers, and handling their failure however you see fit.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc76f86b">
<p>
Writing clear and effective error messages is a crucial skill for any programmer, no matter what the language.  Well-crafted error messages will
improve the usability of software by guiding users to understand and resolve issues quickly. A good error message not only informs the user about
what went wrong but also suggests potential solutions or next steps. In this introductory paragraph, we will explore key principles and techniques
that can help developers create error messages that are informative, actionable, and user-friendly and more importantly take advantage of any
assistance and resources that you may have at your disposal.  I expanded on this a bit more <a href="https://wmealing.github.io/custom-software-errors.html">here</a>.
